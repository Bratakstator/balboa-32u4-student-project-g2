// This example shows how to make a Balboa balance on its two
// wheels and drive around while balancing.
//
// To run this demo, you will need to install the LSM6 library:
//
// https://github.com/pololu/lsm6-arduino
//
// To use this demo, place the robot on the ground with the
// circuit board facing up, and then turn it on.  Be careful to
// not move the robot for a few seconds after powering it on,
// because that is when the gyro is calibrated.  During the gyro
// calibration, the red LED is lit.  After the red LED turns off,
// turn the robot so that it is standing up.  It will detect that
// you have turned it and start balancing.
//
// Alternatively, you can press the A button while the robot is
// lying down and it will try to use its motors to kick up into
// the balancing position.
//
// This demo is tuned for the 50:1 high-power gearmotor with
// carbon brushes, 45:21 plastic gears, and 80mm wheels; you will
// need to adjust the parameters in Balance.h for your robot.
//
// After you have gotten the robot balance well, you can
// uncomment some lines in loop() to make it drive around and
// play a song.
